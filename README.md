This repository includes the code and clearly documentation about a new and efficient approach for masked face recognition, named pairwise differential mask attention (PDMA). Our implementation is done for all expirements: train the baseline CNN, train the mask attention block, build the mask, binarize the mask, finetune the network with the built mask, evaluation and the demo using our model.

I think it is difficult to make a doc for everyone use without error. So, if you get any issues, please let me know on *issues*, I will respond it carefuly.
